Glossary
The product must define voters as a location in the region

Party: An affiliation that differentiates voters
Favored Party: A district's favored party is the party that has the highest representation amongst its voters. A region's favored party is the party that has the highest representation amongst its districts.
Gerrymandering: A process that can sway the favored party of a region towards either party A or party B.
Region: A region is a geographical area that contains voters
Draw: This will create a visual display of any region to a 
District: A grouping of voters that divides the region
Voter: A human that may be affiliated with either Party A or Party B
Grid: The visual representation of a region. For our purposes all regions are simplified into rectangular grids and each grid is composed of squares.
Square: An individual cell of a grid that visually represents a voter. Squares must be filled with one of two distinct colors. 
Color: One color will visually represent that a voter has chosen party A. Another visually distinct color will visually represent that a voter has chosen party B.
