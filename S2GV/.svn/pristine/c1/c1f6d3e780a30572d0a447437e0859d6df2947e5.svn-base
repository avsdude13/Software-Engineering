 * District class is modified by the Districting class.
 * Districts divide regions into groups of voters
 * and there are a set number of districts per region.
 * All districts contain as close as equal as possible
 * number of voters, and the size of any one district
 * can never be greater than 1.
 * Districts are non-overlapping and contiguous.
