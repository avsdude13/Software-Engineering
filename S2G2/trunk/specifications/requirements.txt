Card subproject of Card Games project [$Revision: 295 $]
=====================================

The overall objective of the Card Games project is providing executable models of games that involve the use of playing cards.  A model of playing cards and commonly used aggregations of them is needed to support this objective.

The primary goal of the Card subproject is that of providing a model component that represents individual playing cards and common aggregations of cards.

In this document, "product" refers to the model that represents the information and behavior of cards and card-specific aggregations.  Note that, in this document, the terms "playing card" and "card" are used interchangeably and with identical meaning.
